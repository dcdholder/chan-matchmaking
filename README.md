# WORK IN PROGRESS

## General Idea
This is an application for playing matchmaker, using a database of personal data taken from QT charts.
The first step is to get it working in offline use.

## Challenges
- Figure out how to combine the different chart image data representations with the models
- Write a form application for generating chart data objects (with custom widgets based on the chart image elements)
- Add database search functionality (user-configurable category weightings)
- Find a way to return QT data on the frontend in text and image form
- Find a way to pull text from the text sections
- Figure out how to handle resized images
- Consider adding a censor to the contact info section (would sort of invalidate the whole application TBH)

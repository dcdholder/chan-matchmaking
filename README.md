# Shut-in Matchmaker
https://dcdholder.github.io/

## General Idea
IN PROGRESS
This is an application for playing matchmaker, using a database of personal data taken from QT charts.
Frontend code now has its own repository (https://github.com/dcdholder/dcdholder.github.io) and page.

## Challenges
- Figure out how to combine the different chart image data representations with the models
- Finish the frontend
- Add database search functionality (user-configurable category weightings)
- Find a way to return QT data on the frontend in text and image form
- Find a way to pull text from the text sections
- Consider adding a censor to the contact info section (would sort of invalidate the whole application TBH)
